Every tool has its own OBS browser source overlay, plus a master overlay that shows them all in one source. 
_**NOTE:** The master overlay is buggy and a work in progress_

## Install

1. Download the latest setup exe from [Releases](https://github.com/kics88/S.P.A.R.K/releases/latest).
2. Run it. Windows may warn about an unknown publisher, this is normal for a small unsigned app.
3. The app checks for new versions on startup and shows a banner when one is out.

## Setup

1. Open Settings and connect Twitch. You will need a free Twitch app Client ID, there are in app instruction to 
show you how to get one in about two minutes.
2. Add overlays to OBS as browser sources. Each tab shows its URL, default is `http://localhost:4747/`.
3. For Song Request, install Pear Desktop, enable its API server in the plugin menu and in the expanded menu for
it set the Auth to None, then hit Connect on the Song Request tab.

## Good to know
